*
* Extract date.
*
* Next we have to extract and format the time field, Unfortunately
* this is complicated by the fact that the time in the statistics
* records is stored as a fullword value in hex but using decimal.
*
* So for example if the time the record was recorded was 23:01:10:53
* we would have four bytes with each nibble being a character. So:-
*
* Byte 1 - Bits 1 - 4 = 2
* Byte 1 - Bits 5 - 8 = 3
* Byte 2 - Bits 1 - 4 = 0
* Byte 2 - Bits 5 - 8 = 1
* Byte 3 - Bits 1 - 4 = 1
* Byte 3 - Bits 5 - 8 = 0
* Byte 4 - Bits 1 - 4 = 5
* Byte 4 - Bits 5 - 8 = 3
*
* This complicates extraction because we cannot just reformat the
* data using built-in formats.
*
* What we need to do is manipulate each nibble so we end up with
* an 8 byte ZONED DECIMAL containing the time.
*
* To do this we need to work on each byte twice. First we use DIV
* to divide the first four bits of the byte and then add 240 to it
* to get the zoned decimal value. In this case we change 2 in bits 1-4
* to be two a single byte containing F2.
*
* We use 240 because it is x'F0' so we can get a zoned decimal field.
*
* Next we use MOD to get the remainder of the first byte and add 240 to it.
* This extracts the last 4 bits of the byte and turns it into F3 for us.
*
* We perform the same operation on each byte and end up with the
* following:-
*
* F2F3F0F1F1F0F5F3
*
* We now have zoned decimal values that can be changed for display.
*
* Our output record will look like this:-
*
* Columns     Content
*
* 1-4         Date in packed decimal format.
* 5-8         Unused
* 9-16        Time in zoned decimal format.
* 17-20       Process name in character format.
* 25-28       Process number in binary format.
* 29-44       C:D node name in character format.
* 45-52       Bytes sent in binary format.
* 53-60       Bytes recv in binary format.
* 61-64       Condition code in binary format.
