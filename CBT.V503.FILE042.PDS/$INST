Before you can execute the various jobs certain datasets have to be created
to contain various system drivers.

The datasets that are required are:-

 &HLQSTAT.ARCH.HDR

 This dataset is used to perform C:D signon in certain processes.
 The dataset should be allocated with the following attributes:-

 RECFM    - FB
 DSORG    - PS
 LRECL    - 80
 BLKSIZE  - 0
 SPACE    - TRK 1

 Once created copy the following two records into the dataset:-

  SIGNON
  SELECT STATISTICS WHERE (       -

-----

 &HLQSTAT.ARCH.TRL

 This dataset is used to perform C:D signoff in certain processes.
 The dataset should be allocated with the following attributes:-

 RECFM    - FB
 DSORG    - PS
 LRECL    - 80
 BLKSIZE  - 0
 SPACE    - TRK 1

 Once created copy the following two records into the dataset:-

  SIGNOFF

-----

 &HLQSTAT.PROCLIB

 This dataset is used to contain various JCL members and parameters
 used to drive the system.

 The dataset should be allocated with the following attributes:-

 RECFM    - FB
 DSORG    - PO
 LRECL    - 80
 BLKSIZE  - 0
 SPACE    - TRK 5,1
 DIRBLKS  - 90

 Once created copy from the dataset you are in now to the PROCLIB dataset:-

   CDCOMMS
   CDDIAG
   CDJCL
   CDPARMS

 After copying these members you will need to amend CDPARMS as
 directed in the $CDPARMS member.

 Finally all JCLLIB statements in jobs contained in this dataset will
 need updating with the name of the dataset you have created that
 contains CDCOMMS, CDDIAG, CDJCL and CDPARMS members.

 To change these members execute $REXXUPD after amending it as directed
 in the comments in the REXX exec.
