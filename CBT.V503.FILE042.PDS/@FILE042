//* The contents of the file were created for two purposes.         *   FILE 042
//*                                                                 *   FILE 042
//* 1. SMF exit was developed so statistics records could be        *   FILE 042
//*    directed to SMF so all required records could be maintained  *   FILE 042
//*    in similar manner to our other SMF records.                  *   FILE 042
//*                                                                 *   FILE 042
//* 2. We found many of our customers did not have their            *   FILE 042
//*    statistics files and recording set up adequately and they    *   FILE 042
//*    had no insight as to what Connect Direct itself was doing    *   FILE 042
//*    in writing statistics and what transfers and data were       *   FILE 042
//*    being undertaken each day.                                   *   FILE 042

//*    I developed the various jobs and reports to allow            *   FILE 042
//*    customers to adhoc monitor and manage statistics to          *   FILE 042
//*    assist in performance and problem determination, to allow    *   FILE 042
//*    pro-active performance monitoring of the statistics files,   *   FILE 042
//*    statistics creation and general product performance and      *   FILE 042
//*    to schedule jobs to produce KPIs for management.             *   FILE 042

//*    As well as the above there are some very good examples of    *   FILE 042
//*    how to use DFSORT and ICETOOL to avoid programming in REXX,  *   FILE 042
//*    Assembler or a High Level Lanaguage for report production.   *   FILE 042
